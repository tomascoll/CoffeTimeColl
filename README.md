The NavBar has a Logo, 4 sections of coffee beans and a Cart with the respective number of products in it.

In the Body will be all the coffees in sight, when the user clicks on one of the sections of the NavBar only the coffees corresponding to that section appear.

By keeping the mouse over one of the coffees, the name, the type of coffee and a button to see more details about it will be shown above it. Pressing the button will send us to a mock with more detailed information about the coffee and the availability to add it to the cart.

In the Cart section we will be able to see the selected products with their respective characteristics along with a button to delete the product. After the list of products you will find a button to delete all the products, another one to complete the purchase that will take the user to a form, and see the total of the purchase.
